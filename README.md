# **JUnit Homework**

## Homework by Overone.

### Task: to cover the previously written code with simple tests, at the same time:
* Add new annotations to the tests, and also ignore 2 tests. One with a description, the second without.
* One of the tests is configured to run 7 times to
* Write a method that will require parameterization by strings. Cover it with the appropriate test.

#### The content of the class with methods for testing
* Accepts a string, and returns the number of words in it.
* Accepts a string, removes spaces at the beginning and at the end, and replaces each character 'aâ€™ with a percent sign.
* The conversion result is returned, the method checks whether the string is empty or not.
